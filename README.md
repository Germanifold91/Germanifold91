### Hello there stranger ðŸ•·
Hi there! I'm German Romero. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Mathematics from McGill University and dove deep into the world of data analysis and the lifecycle of machine learning models â€” right from their development to deployment. I've got a knack for ETL processes and love working with Python, and Spark. Turning complex data insights into practical solutions is kind of my thing. Looking forward to connecting and learning about MlOps and Data Engineering.
